h1. Notes

This extension uses of Sean Cribbs excellend radiant-share-layouts-extension (http://github.com/radiant/radiant-share-layouts-extension/tree/master).
The project show view is wrapped in a block like so: 
<pre><code><% content_for :project_body do %></code></pre>
In order to invoke the view on a Radiant page, create a layout called "Project" and insert the following radial tag wherever you want the gallery to appear: 
<pre><code><r:content part="project_body"/></code></pre>
A particular project is viewed using a RESTful URL (e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/project/:id).  Previous/Next links are also displayed in order to navigate between projects.
